# Project 3 Proposal
## Our Goal: Create a web application for small-scale food vendors (farmer's market vendors, "cottage food", food trucks, new restaurants, etc.) to promote themselves to users in their area. 
### Planned Features

* Accounts for users and vendors
* Messaging system for users and vendors to communicate
* Map/Find Vendors page to display closest vendors to a chosen location
* Page for each vendor to describe their wares and the locations where food will be sold
* Review system for users to leave feedback on their experiences with vendors
* Vendors can edit their own page by submitting changes via form update
* Vendors can upload pictures to their page
